# StorageBench Overview

This is a simple synthetic benchmark project for working with
[LMDB](https://symas.com/lmdb/) and different serialization formats:
[ProtocolBuffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) and
[FlatBuffers](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers).

At the point of writing I've seen that ProtocolBuffers are quite good
for managing data in the long-term storage (like events in the commit
log), but have some inherent performance issues. When reading a
ProtoBuf message we use CPU and allocate memory for the entire message
even if only a few fields are needed.

By switching event storage format from ProtoBuf to FlatBuffers on the
[real-time analytics project](https://abdullin.com/bitgn/real-time-analytics/)
I've been able to drop report generation time from 49 to 15
minutes. That time is spent on reading and aggregating 400M events
from the real-time bidding system.

However, while FlatBuffers are very convenient for data that has to be
read frequently, writing these messages or mutating them in a
destructive way isn't that nice. And if you have decided to store some
views in LMDB you have to do some updates at some point.


This is the purpose of this project - to provide some stable place to
compare different storage strategies and benchmark any changes in a
repeatable manner.

# Conclusions

So it looks like:

* FlatBuffers indeed offer significant performance boost on partial
  reads
* Writing performance is comparable
* FlatBuffers take more effort to write an object down or mutate

Note, that LMDB library could potentially benefit from Span/Memory

I needed a way to quickly tweak these projects and including them as
source code was the logical way to do so.
